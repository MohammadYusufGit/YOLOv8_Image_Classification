### YOLOv8 Image Classification Project
This repository contains a YOLOv8-based image classification project that trains, validates, and predicts using a custom dataset. The project leverages the YOLOv8 lightweight model (yolov8n-cls) for efficient image classification tasks.
#### Features
Train a YOLOv8 model on your custom dataset.
Validate the model to evaluate classification performance.
Predict classes for unseen images.
Designed to work seamlessly with Google Colab.
